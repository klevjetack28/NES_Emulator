# NES_Emulator

Project Goal
I want to learn more about computer architecture and how low level systems work. I want to create my own emulator and get a better understanding of how systems work and connect to each other. Find how systems can be vulnerable at the low level. Also refine my knowledge of lower level languages like C, C++ and learn a new language like Rust.

Project Scope
TBD

End Result
The end result of the project is to have a fully functional NES Emulator. As long as you are able to find the game's ROM, you should be able to load it into the emulator and play your desired game. You can save previously loaded ROMs for quicker load times and have access to a full debugger.

Roadmap


Tech Stack
